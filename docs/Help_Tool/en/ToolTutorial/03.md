% No03. Let's display the image!

<div class="main">

## Overview
In this chapter, images are displayed on particles.
Until now it was a white square, but the white square changes to an image.
In addition, we will gradually make the particles transparent and change color.

## Preliminary knowledge - When the window is closed, the arrangement of windows is wrong

We will operate various windows from this chapter.
If you switch windows, the placement may become strange or it may close.
In that case, select "Window" in the menu bar.
When "Reset Window Position" is selected, the position of each window is returned to the initial position.
If you select the name of each window, you can open that window.

## Display image

It is troublesome to prepare images yourself, so we can download the pre-created effects from the link below.

### Image settings

Let's set the image to the white square immediately.
The image is set from the "Basic Render Settings" window.
By default, this window will not be displayed on the screen even if you click on a node.
Click "Basic Render Settings" on the tab on the lower right.

<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/Tutorial/03_tab_en.png">
<p>Tab</p>
</div>

Click on the "Basic Render Settings" tab and then click on the node, the "Basic Render Settings" window will be displayed.

<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/Tutorial/03_rendercommon_en.png">
<p>"Basic Render Settings" window</p>
</div>

Click the Load button in the picture of "Basic Render Settings" window.
When clicked, a window for selecting the image is displayed.
Select particle.png.
When you select an image, the image will also be displayed on Effekseer.

<div align="center">

</div>

When you play the effect, you can see that the white square has changed to an image.

### Fade in and out settings

It is unnatural for particles to appear suddenly or disappear.
Let's set fade in and fade out so that the transparency change.

Fade in can be set by changing the value of fade in in the "Basic Render Settings" window.
Similarly, fade-out can be set by changing the value of fade-out in the "Basic Render Settings" window.
We will enter 15 for both this time.

<div align="center">

<p>Fade</p>
</div>

You can see that the effect appears and disappears gradually.

### Sprite

Effekseer has several drawing methods.
The default method is "Sprite". You can draw rectangular particles.
Although it is difficult only by the contents described up to this chapter, you can create such an effect.

<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/Tutorial/03_sprite.png">
<p>Sprite</p>
</div>

In the "Render Settings" window, you can set the functions specific to the currently selected drawing method.
Let's display the "Drawing" window as it displayed the "Basic Render Settings" window.

</div>

#### Color settings

You have set transparency with fade in, but You cannot set the color of the particles.
Although there is no problem if the image is colorful, you will need to prepare multiple images to change the color for each particle.
Therefore, you can specify a rough trend of color of particles if a sprite is selected.

You can specify that color in the "Render Settings" window. There are several methods to specify colors.
For this time you choose random as the color changes for each particle.
Then you set the amplitude of the value to 255. This means that values are randomly chosen between 0 and 512 colors.
However, since the maximum color value is 255, values are chosen between 0 and 255.

<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/Tutorial/03_color_en.png">
<p>Specifiy a color</p>
</div>

You can see that the color is different for each particle.

### Blend settings

Effekseer allows you to set the method of alpha blending of particles.
Blend is a method of combining particles and background.
As shown in the figure below, you can just draw particles or add it to the background.

<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/Tutorial/03_blendmode.png">
<p>Blend mode</p>
</div>

For this time you set the method of blending to add for brightening the particles.
You can set the blend method in the "Basic Render Settings" window.

<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/Tutorial/03_blend_en.png">
<p>Blend mode</p>
</div>

If you add the method of blending, you can see that the particles are displayed bright.

## Summery

In this chapter, we changed the sprite parameters to improve the appearance of the particles.
In the next chapter, we will explain the shape of sprites, rotation and enlargement of particles.
