% No12. Let's specify complicated movement with F-Curve!

<div class="main">

## Overview

In this chapter, We use F-Curve to specify complicated movements.
I already have explained various ways of moving particles.
In many cases, only those functions are sufficient.
However, there are times when it is not enough.
So let's use F-Curve to change freely to whatever value you like.

However, I do not create specific effects in this chapter.
The above image is an effect that can be created with the knowledge of this chapter or previous chapters.

## F-Curve

In Effekseer, you can control the parameters by setting a curve called F-Curve.
Parameters that can be controlled are position, angle, scale, color, and so on.

Let's open the F-Curve window.
Select the F-Curve from the menu. Then a window for editing the F-Curve appears.

<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/Tutorial/12/init_en.png" width="80%">
</div>

However, the F-Curve to be edited is not displayed.

Select the F curve from ```Position``` window.

Then, an editable F-Curve label is displayed on the left side of the F-Curve window.

Left click on the displayed label, the F-Curve is displayed.

<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/Tutorial/12/init_en.png" width="80%">
</div>

Double-click the F-Curve to add a control point to the F-Curve.
You can see that by double clicking, the control point is added.
Let's add two control points.

<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/Tutorial/12/two_points_en.png" width="80%">
</div>

You can move the control point by selecting it with the left click and dragging the control point.
Let's move the control point so that the value changes.

<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/Tutorial/12/add_points_en.png" width="80%">
</div>

When you try to play it, you can see that particles move along the F-Curve.

<div align="center">

</div>

You can control the curve freely.
Select the control point and click on ```Enlarge anchor``` in the upper left.
Then you will see an anchor for controlling the curve.
Let's move the anchor and change the curve.

<img src="../../img/Tutorial/12/curve_en.png" width="80%">
</div>

<div align="center">

</div>

If you choose ```Shrink anchor```, the value change suddenly.

<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/Tutorial/12/add_points_en.png" width="80%">
</div>

To delete a control point, double-click the control point.

You can express complecated movements with comvining these functions.

You can control angle and color as well as position.

### Sampling

Effekseer actually uses F-curve approximated values.
Therefore, it may not be able to approximate sudden change of value.
In that case, decrease ```Sampling```.
Then you will be able to approximate sudden change in value.

### Useful operation

#### Multiple selecting

You can edit multiple F-Curves at the same time by Shift and left clicking on the F-Curve label.

You can also select multiple control points with Shift and left clicking. Multiple control points also can be moved.

#### Show entire graph

Double-clicking the label of F-Curve displays the corresponding F-Curve as a whole.

<div align="center">

</div>

You can create complicated effects by taking advantage of these knowledge.
