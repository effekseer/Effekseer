% No05. Let's create a hit mark (Slashing)!

<div class="main">

## Overview

In this chapter, you create an effect (hit mark) hit by a slash as used in an actual game.
It is an effect where a sword line is expressed in the middle and small impacts flies around.
In doing so, we explain copying and adding nodes and easing particles as new contents.

</div>

## Preparation

We made it possible to download the effect created in advance from the link below.

<div align="center">
<a href = "../../Sample/05_01_Sample.zip">Download</a>
</div>

Since the length of the effect created is about 0.5 seconds, <s>"end"</s> in <s>"viewer operation"</s> window is specified to 30 frames.

## Easing

Easing is often used for various parameters.

Easing is a method of representing changes in values by specifying the values of the start and end points and automatically interpolating the values between them.

As shown in the figure below, position, rotation and scale have been specified by speed (1) or acceleration up to now.
However, with this specified method, the longer the survival time becomes, the larger the value becomes.

On the other hand, in easing, specify the value (2) just after generation and the value (3) just before disappearing, and interpolate between values.
Since you can specify the value just before disappearing, the shape of the particle becomes easy to understand.

<div align="center">

</td>
<td>

<p>イージング</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

There are several interpolation methods. Low speed 3 to high speed 3 can be specified for the start and end points respectively.
The lower the speed, the harder the value changes, the faster the value, the easier the value changes.

## Create the effect

Effects are not often composed of single kind of particles but plural kinds of completely different looking particles.
Effekseer can have multiple nodes. You can give completely different parameters for each node.
Hit marks must also consist of more than one node. This time, you will create the nodes in order.

The direction of this effect is as follows.

* The playback time is about 0.5 seconds (30 frames)

* Color is purple (255, 32, 255) to pink (255, 128, 255)

### Sword line node

You create a node where a particle slenderly cuts at an angle of 45 degrees, representing a sword line.

The sword line is specified to elongate in the direction of 45 degrees during 0.33 seconds (20 frames).
<s>Z-axis rotating billboard</s> is specified to tilt the particles.

Values are changed as follows.

<b>This chapter has many values to change. Even if the atmosphere is alike, it is not necessary to make them all the same.</b>

|ウインドウ|値の名称|値|
|:----|:----|:----|
|共通|名称|Line1|
|共通|生存時間|20|
|回転|角度(度)|x=0, y=0, z=-45|
|拡大|拡大方法|イージング|
|拡大|始点(中心)|x=4, y=1, z=1|

|拡大|始点速度|高速3|
|拡大|終点速度|低速3|
|描画共通|色/歪み画像|Texture/Line01.png|

|描画|全体色-終点(中心)|255,255,255,0|
|描画|全体色-始点速度|低速3|
|描画|全体色-終点速度|高速3|

At this point the effect is now as follows.

<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/Tutorial/05_01.gif">
<p>Sword line node</p>
</div>

### Impact node

When the attack hits, not only the sword line but also the impact is generated.
Impact node is created like a sword wire.

Since the parameters of the sword line node and impact node are different, you need to add a node.
First, you select Root. Then right click on Root to display the menu.
From the menu, you choose Add Node.

<div align="center">

<p>Adding node</p>
</div>

When the node is added, you click on the added node and edit that node.

The value ares changed as follows.

|ウインドウ|値の名称|値|
|:----|:----|:----|
|共通|名称|Line2|
|共通|生成数|10|
|共通|生存時間|20|
|回転|回転方法|角度・速度・加速度|
|回転|角度(度)-振幅|x=0, y=0, z=180|
|拡大|拡大方法|イージング|
|拡大|始点(中心)|x=1, y=1, z=1|
|拡大|終点(中心)|x=1, y=10, z=1|
|拡大|始点速度|高速3|
|拡大|終点速度|低速3|
|描画共通|色/歪み画像|Texture/Line01.png|

|描画|配置方法|Z軸回転ビルボード|
|描画|全体色|イージング|
|描画|全体色-始点(中心)|255,128,255,255|
|描画|全体色-終点(中心)|255,255,255,0|
|描画|全体色-始点速度|低速3|
|描画|全体色-終点速度|高速3|

fect is now as follows.

### Light emitting node No.1

Glowing effects at the moment of hit is better looking.
The light emmiting node is also specified same as the sword line node.

Values are changed as fllows.

|ウインドウ|値の名称|値|
|:----|:----|:----|
|共通|名称|Flash1|
|共通|生存時間|20|
|拡大|拡大方法|単一拡大率・速度・加速度|
|拡大|拡大速度|0.6|
|描画共通|色/歪み画像|Texture/Particle01.png|
|描画共通|ブレンド|加算|
|描画|全体色|イージング|
|描画|全体色-始点(中心)|255,32,255,255|
|描画|全体色-終点(中心)|255,128,255,0|
|描画|全体色-始点速度|低速3|
|描画|全体色-終点速度|高速3|

At this point the effect is now as follows.

<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/Tutorial/05_03.gif">
<p>Light emitting node No.1</p>
</div>

### Light emitting node No.2

New emiitting node is added because the light emission is still sober.
This light emitting node is almost same as the light emitting node created earlier.
Effekseer can copy nodes.

After selecting the lighting node, right click to copy the node.

<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/Tutorial/05_copynode_ja.png">
<p>Adding node</p>
</div>

After selecting Root, right-click to paste the node.

<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/Tutorial/05_pastenode_ja.png">
<p>Adding node</p>
</div>

You can see that the light emmitng node has been duplicated.

The changed values from the original light emmiting node are as follows.

|ウインドウ|値の名称|値|
|:----|:----|:----|
|共通|名称|Flash2|
|描画共通|色/歪み画像|Texture/Particle03.png|

You could create an effect that a slash hit.

## Summary

In this chapter, You created effects that are likely to actually be used in games.
In the next chapter, you will create even more complicated effects.
