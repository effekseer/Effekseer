% No04. Let's rotate and enlarge!

<div class="main">

## Overview
In this chapter, we rotate and enlarge particles.
We also change the sprite shape from a square to a rectangle.
This makes it possible to create complicated effects.

## Rotation and expansion

We made it possible to download the effect created in advance from the link below.

### Rotation

Let's rotate the particles immediately.
Rotation can be specified from the "Rotation" window.

Click an icon of "Rotation" window to show "Rotation" window.

<div align="center">

</div>

<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/Tutorial/04_rotation_en.png">
<p>"Rotation" window</p>
</div>

Just like the position, there are multiple ways to specify rotation.
By default, ```Fixed angle``` is selected.
Change this to ```PVA```.
Then enter 5 for ```Angular Velocity``` z.

This means that you rotate 5 degrees per frame about the Z direction (front direction) as the axis.

<p>Angular velocity</p>
</div>


After inputting, you play the effect ... nothing changes!
This is because in the initial setting of drawing by sprite, the sprite always faces the front even if the particle rotates.

In the "Basic Render Settings" window, change the ```Configuration``` to ```Rotated Billboard```.
```Rotated Billboard``` is a layout method in which the rectangular shape faces the front while the Z axis rotation is enable.

<img src="../../img/Tutorial/04_conf_en.png">
<p>Configuration</p>
</div>

When setting the  ```Configuration``` to ```Rotated Billboard```, you can see that the rectangle rotates about the Z direction (front direction).

### Scale

As with position and rotation, you can scale particles.
You can specify scale from the "Sale" window.

Click an icon of "Scale" window to show "Scale" window.

<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/Tutorial/04_scale_icon.png">
<p>An icon of Scale window</p>
</div>

<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/Tutorial/04_scale_en.png">
<p>"Scale" window</p>
</div>

Just like the position and rotation, there is also a way to specify more than one in the scale.
In the initial setting, the ```Fixed Scale``` is selected.
Change this to ```PVA(Single)```.
Then input 0.01 for ```Expansion Speed```.

```Expansion Speed``` can also be set individually in the X, Y, Z direction, but ```Expansion Speed``` is often the same for all directions.
Therefore, you can set a ```Expansion Speed```.

<div align="center">

</div>

You can see that the sprite is rotating and enlarging.

</div>

## Sprite shape

Sprite shape can be changed from square into rectangle, trapezoid, etc.

Change ```Vertex Coords``` from the "Render Settings" window, from ```Default``` to ```Fixed```.
Then you can specify the coordinates of the vertices of the sprite.

For this time, let's input as follows to enlarge the sprite vertically.

<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/Tutorial/04_v_en.png">
<p>Vertex Coords</p>
</div>

You can see that the vertical length of sprite is longer than horizontal length of one.

</div>

## Finish

Since it is not good looking as it is, you change parameters as follows.

### The "Basic Settings" window

Change ```Spawn Count``` to 10

### The "Position" window

-Change into PVA
-Change Pos deviation into 2

### The "Basic Render Settings" window

Select the ```Texture``` into particle.png

Change the ```Blend``` into ```Additive```

### The "Rotation" window

Change angle(Derivation) Z  into 180

### The "Scale" window

Change ```Scaling Factor``` into 0

### Result

If you do not know how to change these parameters, please review chapters 1 to 3.

## Summary

In this chapter, we explained the sprite rotation and enlargement.
In the next chapter, we will create practical effects by making the most of our knowledge.
